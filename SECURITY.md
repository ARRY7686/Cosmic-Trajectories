# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within **Cosmic-Trajectories**, we encourage you to report it as soon as possible. We take security seriously and will work with you to resolve any issues as quickly as possible.

To report a vulnerability, please follow the steps below:

1. **Email us directly** at [aadigupta2007@yahoo.com](mailto:aadigupta2007@yahoo.com) with a clear description of the issue, including steps to reproduce if applicable.
2. **Do not disclose** the vulnerability to the public or other parties until it has been addressed and resolved. This ensures that potential exploits are minimized.

## Security Patches

Once a vulnerability is reported, we will investigate the issue and work on a patch. The patch will be released as soon as possible, and the details of the fix will be included in the release notes.

We aim to respond to security issues within **72 hours** of receiving a report and will provide an update on the resolution timeline.

## Security Best Practices

We encourage contributors to follow best security practices while working on the **Cosmic-Trajectories** project. Here are some guidelines:

- **Use HTTPS** for all external communication and APIs.
- **Keep dependencies up to date** to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
- **Follow secure coding practices** to prevent common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Review and test** changes thoroughly before submitting them to ensure that they do not introduce security issues.
